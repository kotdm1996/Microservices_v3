was trying to make it work.
but some how pods were crashing as soon as I was changing replicas = 2

had configuration for liveness prob
and resource request...but unfortunately adding these configurations was causing pods to crash as well

 resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "500m"    # Minimum CPU allocation (100 milliCPU)
            memory: "4096Mi" # Minimum memory allocation (128 MiB)
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"    # Maximum CPU allocation (500 milliCPU)
            memory: "4096Mi" # Maximum memory allocation (512 MiB)

livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz  # Endpoint to check if the app is alive
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30  # Delay before the first probe
          periodSeconds: 10         # How often to perform the probe
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready  # Endpoint to check if the app is ready
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5   # Delay before the first probe
          periodSeconds: 10         # How often to perform the probe
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "500m"    # Minimum CPU allocation (100 milliCPU)
            memory: "4096Mi" # Minimum memory allocation (128 MiB)
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"    # Maximum CPU allocation (500 milliCPU)
            memory: "4096Mi" # Maximum memory allocation (512 MiB)
